## Key Features of the Project

### 1. Property Data Extraction
The scraping process collects detailed property listings from various websites. This includes essential information such as:
- `Property address`: Location of the property.
- `Price`: Current listing price of the property.
- `Bedrooms/Bathrooms`: Number of bedrooms and bathrooms.
- `Square footage`: Total area of the property in square feet.
- `Property type`: Residential, commercial, etc.
- `Listing agent`: The real estate agent associated with the listing.
- `Listing date`: Date the property was listed for sale or rent.

This comprehensive dataset enables users to analyze trends in property pricing, availability, and demand in specific areas.

### 2. Agent Data Extraction
In addition to properties, agent details are also scraped to provide insights into real estate professionals. This includes:
- `Agent name`: The real estate agent's name.
- `Agency`: The real estate firm or agency they represent.
- `Contact information`: Phone number or email for direct contact.
- `Listings managed`: Properties currently managed by the agent.
- `Agent rating`: Where available, ratings or reviews of the agent's services.

This data is particularly useful for agent profiling, enabling users to select agents based on experience, number of listings, and reviews.

### 3. Location-Based Scores
To help users evaluate properties based on neighborhood or local amenities, the project gathers location-specific data such as:
- `Walk Score`: Measures walkability and access to nearby services.
- `Microburbs Score`: Rates the neighborhood's lifestyle, culture, and environment.
- `Transit Score`: Rates public transportation access and convenience.

These scores help users make informed decisions based on the property's surroundings, enabling them to choose properties in areas that meet their lifestyle preferences.

## Benefits of the Project

- **Market Analysis**: The scraped data enables a thorough analysis of property trends, price fluctuations, and demand in different regions.
- **Property Valuation**: Accurate and up-to-date property data helps users determine the market value of real estate for investment or personal buying purposes.
- **Agent Profiling**: Comprehensive agent data allows users to compare agents based on their performance, reputation, and contact availability, making it easier to choose the right agent.
- **Efficient Data Collection**: The automated scraping approach significantly improves the speed and efficiency of collecting real estate data, eliminating the need for manual data entry.
